# Excel-Dividend-Discount-Model
A Excel VBA powered UI to compute stock intrinsic value

This Excel VBA application uses Yahoo Finance (now deprecated) to retrieve stock dividends, historical prices and fundamental ratios (EPS, Volatility, Beta, PE etc..).

This application is meant to assist investors in making investment decisions.

Some UI snipplets (note that the code is no longer working as API links are deprecated):

1) Dashboard UI

2) UI to input stock ticker for data retrieval once UserForm button is clicked
